# csc413 - TankGame

## Student Name : Thomas Sechrist

### This is a small 2d, 2 player tank game where the object is to destroy the other tank. I made this game from scratch and it is highly modular in its construction so I can reuse the engine to create other projects easily.

### Player 1 controls with w, s, a, d, and the space bar.
### Player 2 controls with up, down, left, right arrow keys, and the enter key.
